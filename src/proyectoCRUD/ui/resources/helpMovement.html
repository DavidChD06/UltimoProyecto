            <h3>Account Movements: Help</h3>

            <h4>General Description</h4>
            <p>This window allows you to view and manage the financial movements of a specific account. 
            Users can track their transaction history in the central table, register new operations, 
            or revert the last action performed. Additionally, the updated balance is displayed at the top.</p>

            <h4>Operations</h4>

            <strong>New movement</strong>
            <p>To register a new operation, the user must select the <strong>Type</strong> of movement 
            (Deposit or Payment) from the dropdown menu and enter the value in the <strong>Amount</strong> field. 
            Once the data is entered, click the <strong>New movement</strong> button. 
            If the operation is successful, the movement will appear in the table and the balance will be updated automatically.</p>

            <strong>Undo last movement</strong>
            <p>If the user needs to revert the last action performed, click the <strong>Undo last movement</strong> button. 
            The system will remove the most recent record from the table and restore the account's previous balance.</p>

            <strong>Data Visualization</strong>
            <p>The central table displays the list of movements with the following details:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>DATE:</strong> The date the movement was recorded.</li>
                    <li><strong>AMOUNT:</strong> The value of the operation.</li>
                    <li><strong>TYPE:</strong> The category or type of movement(Deposit/Payment).</li>
                    <li><strong>BALANCE:</strong> The resulting balance after the operation.</li>
                </ul>
                If there are no records, the table would be empty until you create a movemet
            </p>
            <strong>Exit</strong>
            <p>Clicking the <strong>Exit</strong> button will close the current view and redirect you back to the <strong>Accounts</strong> window.</p>
